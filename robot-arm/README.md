robot-arm (api)
===

## Note
This software is designed to work with Python2.7 under following conditions:
- This software depends on the following libraries:
 - OpenCV3.2 (need to be compiled from source.)
  - Refer to [setup/README.md](../setup/README.md) for installation.
- Environment variables
    ```
    export FLASK_ENV='prd'   # choices are 'prd', 'stg' or 'dev'
    export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
    ```

- Configuration files
  - web/config.py
    - DOBOT_SERVE_XY = (0, -150) # the destination of served candies.

- Network
  - TCP port 18001 need to be exposed to browser.

## Run
After tuning the robot, you can start robot-arm.
```
$ sudo systemctl start uwsgi-robot.service
```
In this setup senario, the next command is not used. We use nginx+uWSGI instead.
```
# Run app. This requres environment variables.
$ python2 run_api.py  # Be sure to use python2.7
```
