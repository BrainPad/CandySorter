## Note
This software is design to work with Python2.7 under following condition.
- This software depends on the following libraries:
 - OpenCV3.2 (need to be compiled from source.)
  - Refer to [installation_instructions.md](../setup/installation_instructions.md) for installation.
 - Softwares you need to install from pip
 ```
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
  ex)
  - Flask
  - uWSGI
  - numpy
  - pyserial

- Environment variables
    ```
    export FLASK_ENV='prd'   # choices are 'prd', 'stg' or 'dev'
    export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
    ```

- Configuration files
  - web/config.py
    - DOBOT_SERVE_XY = (0, -150) # the destination of served candies.

- Network
  - TCP port 18001 need to be exposed to browser.

$ python2 run_api.py  # Be sure python2.7 is selected
```

## API example

- POST /api/pickup
  - Pick up a candy at given coordinates and serve it.
  - `curl -XPOST -d'{"x":150, "y":150}' --header "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:18001/api/pickup`

- GET /api/status
