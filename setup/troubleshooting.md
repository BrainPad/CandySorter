Trouble shooting
====


You may encounter some troubles, since we put our enphasis on making this demo simple and low cost.

Camera troubles
---
#### 'No device' message appears when executing camera_tune.py.
- It is likely to happen after you re-attach usb devices, because linux generates device files everytime you plug in usb devices or reboot whole system.


1. Change the permision of device file.
 ```
 sudo chmod 777 /dev/video0
 ```
2. Rerun camera_tune.py .

#### How can I control focus or exposure of camera.
1. Turn the robot arm to the opposite, so that the camera won't see in sight.
2. Run 'camera_tune.py'
3. (See how the focus is working on the screen.
   You should see 4 markers on each corner of A3 sheet.)
4. If it's not well focused, push the focus button, right next to the slide switch located on top.
5. Wait until focus is fixed.(takes about 2-3 seconds.)
6. If the 'OK' sign does not appears, try exposure buttons to make picture brighter or dimmer.

#### camera_tune.py returns error message `Gtk-WARNING \*\*: cannot open display` on terminal.

If you login to the linux box via ssh, this likely happens.
1. You first login to the desktop.
2. Then run 'camera_tune.py' after run.




Robot troubles
---
#### How can I update Dobot Magicians firmware
- In order to update your firmware of Dobot Magician, you may need DobotStudio.
- Be sure that you are getting the right DobotStudio for your Dobot Magician.


1. Download DobotStudio from [dobot.cc](http://dobot.cc/download-center/dobot-magician.html)
2. Install DobotStudio to your PC/Mac
3. Power up dobot and connect to your PC/Mac
4. Run DobotStudio
6. The popup appears on screen and proceed to the installation.
   If it doesn't appear just push the 'Connect' button and upgrade from the menu.



#### The 'robot_tune.py' is returning "`dobot offline`".

- It is likely to happen after you re-attach usb devices, because linux generates device files everytime you plug in usb devices or reboot whole system.


1. Change the permision of device file.
   ```
   sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
   ```
2. Run robot_tune.py again.





#### The 'robot_tune.py' is returning "`unpack requires a string argument of length 38`".
- Also I recommend you to update the firmware of dobot by using DobotStudio on windows PC.
- If it still doesn't work after upgrade, try to rename the dobot from the device menu of DobotStudio and name it 'dobot'.
- (Once it gets work, it keeps working.)



#### How do I reset the robot when it is bumpy?
- This may happen, when you hit the robot arm during its operation.


1. Update the dobot firmware, if you never did.
     (You need DobotStudio from [dobot.cc](http://dobot.cc/download.html) )
2. Turn off the power switch of dobot.
3. Unplug the USB cable.
4. Unplug the power cable.
5. Plug the USB cable again.
6. Plug the power cable again.
7. Change the permision of device file.
   ```
   sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
   ```
   Note: This is only needed when you didn't do the permanent permission setting (see [linux_box.md](./linux_box.md) ).
8. Restart the robot-arm's uWSGI to reload fixed cordinates.
   ```
   sudo systemctl stop nginx.service
   sudo systemctl restart uwsgi-robot.service
   sudo systemctl start nginx.service
   ```
9. Run the robot_tune.py.




Demo is not working
---
#### Error 504 on browser
- Until all models are loaded to webapp, all requests will be timed out with error 504 .
- The following is a list of all models loading during startup of webapp.
   - word2vec models (this is very large model and takes about 3to4 minutes to load.)
   - inception model
   - transfer model

   (* You can see the progress that has been made in webapp/log/app.log .)


1. Just wait for 3 minutes.(It takes a little while until all the data is loaded at begining .)
2. If it is still not working and cpu is not busy, just restart.
   ```
   sudo systemctl stop nginx.service
   sudo systemctl restart uwsgi-robot.service
   sudo systemctl start nginx.service
   ```


#### Error 502 on browser
- uWSGI may be not working.
  ```
  sudo systemctl start uwsgi-webapp.service
  ```
  If it still does not work, check for the permission of /var/run/uwsgi.


- uWSGIi(webapp) is stuck in the middle of `systemctl` command

  Please do the following thing
  ```
  chmod 777 /var/log/uwsgi   # just make sure
  sudo systemctl stop nginx.service
  sudo systemctl stop uwsgi-webapp.service
  sudo kill -9 <the process # of `/usr/local/bin/uwsgi --ini /etc uwsgi/webapp.ini`>
  sudo rm /var/run/uwsgi/webapp.*
  ```
  Wait for a while, and then start uwsgi.

  I'm not sure but may be it's safer to stop nginx before rebooting any uWSGI service.
